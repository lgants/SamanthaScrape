# SamanthaScrape

Use [watir.rb](https://github.com/lgants/SamanthaScrape/blob/master/watir.rb) to scrape court filings from the Plaquemines Parish Court of Louisiana located at https://cotthosting.com/laplaquemines/LandRecords/protected/SrchQuickName.aspx.

Beware! The scraper starts at January 20th of the desired year, rather than the 1st. We don't know why.
